(Built from data downloaded on 2015-04-08)

Data from the Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary.

The dictionary is large (70 MB) and hosted elsewhere, so it's not included in
the repo. But you can download the dictionary [from the Cologne Digital
Sanskrit Dictionaries project](mw), if you so choose.

[mw]: http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/download.html


However, the repo *does* include some supplemental data that can't be
downloaded so easily. This is in the "Greek data" section below.


The files
---------

### `indeclinables.csv`
(Headers: `name`)

Indeclinables, including adverbs, particles (*nipāta*), and more.

### `nominal-stems.csv`
(Headers: `stem,stem_genders`)

Nominal stems, including nouns and adjectives. Adjectives have the `mfn` gender.

### `prefixed_roots.csv`
(Headers: `prefixed_root,unprefixed_root,hom`)

Unprefixed verb roots, including nominal roots.

### `unprefixed_roots.csv`
(Headers: `root,hom,class,voice`)

Prefixed verb roots.

### `verb-prefixes.csv`
(Headers: `name,prefix_type`)

Verb prefixes, excluding *upasarga*s.

Greek data
----------

The dictionary uses a variety of Greek terms. In `monier.xml`, these are
written as `<gk>1</gk>`, `<gk>2</gk>`, and so on. These numbers are indices
into a separate list:

### `greeklist.csv`
The list of Greek terms.

The list is a CSV file with `L,betacode,index` for a header:

- `L` is the unique ID associated with the entry in the dictionary.
- `betacode` is the [Beta Code](betacode) of the original Greek. (Just as
  Sanskrit has Harvard-Kyoto and ITRANS, Greek has Betacode.)
- `index` is the corresponding index.

So if entry `4` contains `<gk>2</gk>`, `2` should be replaced by the
corresponding betacode (in this case, `A)N`).

In retrospect, `L,index,betacode` is a more intuitive order, but it's not
really worth changing.

Column types
------------

- `class`: the verb class. Possible values:
  - `1` for class 1 (`gacCati`)
  - `2` for class 2 (`atti`)
  - `3` for class 3 (`juhoti`)
  - `4` for class 4 (`dIvyati`)
  - `5` for class 5 (`sunoti`)
  - `6` for class 6 (`tudati`)
  - `7` for class 7 (`ruRadDi`)
  - `8` for class 8 (`tanoti`)
  - `9` for class 9 (`krIRAti`)
  - `10` for class 10 (`corayati`)
  - `denom` for denominative verbs (`putrIyati`)
- `hom`: short for *homonym*, this distinguishes two roots that sound the same
  but have different meanings. Possible values are either the empty string or
  a number (e.g. `1`). These come straight from the MW dictionary.
- `prefix_type`: the type of the verb prefix. Possible values;
  - `cvi` for *cvi* prefixes
  - `DAc` for *ḍāc* prefixes
  - `other` for other prefixes (excluding *upasarga*s)
- `prefixed_root`: see `root`
- `root`: the root that produced the form (`gam`).
- `stem`: the stem that produced the form (`nara`).
- `stem_genders`: the grammatical genders of the stem, since a single stem can
  be inflected in multiple genders. Possible values:
  - `m` for masculine (`nara`)
  - `f` for feminine (`vidyA`)
  - `n` for neuter (`Pala`)
  - `mf` for masculine or feminine
  - `fn` for feminine or neuter
  - `mn` for masculine or neuter
  - `mfn` for any gender. This is used for adjectives.
  - `none` for non-gendered stems (`mad`)
- `unprefixed_root`: see `root`
- `voice`: the verb voice. Possible values:
  - `atma` for atmanepada
  - `para` for parasmaipada
