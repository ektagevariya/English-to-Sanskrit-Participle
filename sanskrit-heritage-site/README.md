`sanskrit-heritage-site`
========================

Data from the [Sanskrit Heritage Site](http://sanskrit.inria.fr).

The [original data](http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DATA/XML/) is a set of XML
documents:

- `SL_adverbs.xml` for miscellaneous indeclinables.
- `SL_final.xml` for miscellaneous words.
- `SL_nouns.xml` for nouns, adjectives, and numbers.
- `SL_parts.xml` for inflected participles.
- `SL_pronouns.xml` for pronoun data.
- `SL_roots.xml` for inflected verbs.

`SL_nouns.xml`, `SL_pronouns`, and parts of `SL_adverbs.xml` and `SL_final.xml`
are superseded by the data in the other folders. So, this folder contains the
following data instead:


The files
---------

### `adverbs.csv`

(Headers: `name,root,pos,modification`)

`-tvA` gerunds. This file was generated from `SL_adverbs.xml`.


### `final.csv`

(Headers: `name,root,pos,modification`)

Infinitives and `-ya` gerunds. This file was generated from `SL_final.xml`.


### `parts.csv`

(Headers: `stem,root,class,mode,voice,modification`)

Participle stems. This file was generated from an older version of
`SL_parts.xml`, since the newer version doesn't expose root information.


### `roots.csv`

(Headers: `name,root,class,person,number,mode,voice,modification`)

Inflected verbs. This file was generated from `SL_roots.xml`.
